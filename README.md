# wall-painting-robot-Python-Arduino-
This is a real wall painting robot I made when I was a student.
It consists of 3 parts as mechanical, electronic and software. Here I will only give software information.
The software of the robot has 2 options.

1. Automatic motion --> Arduino
2. Control from computer --> Python+Pyqt5+Arduino
